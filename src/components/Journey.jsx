                    <p className='text-justify mt-10 '>Years ago, fresh out of dental school, Dr. Medica envisioned a dental practice that went beyond just treating dental issues. We dreamed of a placewhere patients felt at ease, where their fears were understood, and where their smiles were valued as much as their dental health. Armed with her determination, she took a leap of faith and founded Smile Haven Dental Clinic.
                        <br />
                        <br />Nothing is more important to us than delivering high-quality, accessible care. Dr. Main and our team remain at the forefront of modern dentistry. Weâ€™ll help you feel at home in our easy-going environment. We also offer sedation & relaxation amenities</p>
